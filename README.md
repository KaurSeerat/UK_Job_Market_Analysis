## UK Job Market Analysis (2023) – Power BI Dashboard

This project analyses UK job postings from 2023 to identify patterns in hiring demand, geographic distribution, contract prevalence, and salary trade-offs. Using Power BI, the dashboard provides a structured view of which roles and locations had the highest demand, how contract roles compare to permanent positions, and how pay varies across job categories.

The analysis focuses on clean aggregation logic, transparent assumptions, and insight-driven visualisation rather than forecasting, making it suitable as a cross-sectional snapshot of the 2023 UK job market.
